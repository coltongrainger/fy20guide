  <title>Hello and Welcome!</title>

  <assemblage>
    <p>This chapter is a whirlwind review of the mathematical prerequisities for MATH 2510. We will see how: to manipulate algebraic expressions, to graph in Cartesian coordinates, to solve simultaneous systems of equations, and to describe sets by their elements.</p>

  <p>This material will not be directly examined. However, it's <emph>good practice</emph> and <emph>vaguely resembles 2 years of high school algebra</emph>.</p>
  </assemblage>

  <p>Perhaps you'll want to test yourself against some of the inline <webwork /> exercises, which look like:</p>

      <title>Nice example of an inline problem (which we'll later know how to answer)</title>
      <webwork source="Library/UMN/algebraKaufmannSchwitters/ks_15_2_25.pg"/>
    </exercise>

    <p>If a problem is broken, kindly email Colton: <url href="mailto:colton.grainger@colorado.edu?subject=pretext-student-guide">colton.grainger@colorado.edu</url>.</p>

    <p>Note that you have as many attempts on this problems as you would like. At any time you can (say mercy! and) look at the solutions. </p>

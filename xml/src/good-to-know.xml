        First and most importantly, congratulations! If you are enrolled in MATH 2150, you have proven
        yourself to be a smart, hardworking individual capable of learning complicated material and
        improving your statistics skills. The admissions office doesnâ€™t make mistakes: you belong at
        CU Boulder, and you belong in this class. You are welcome here.
    </p>
  </assemblage>

<p>This chapter is a quick review of the mathematical prerequisities for MATH 2150: manipulating numbers, overcoming mistakes, setting up coordinate systems, and solving simultaneous equations. </p>

<p>This material will not be directly examined, but I've included it regardless. It seems wise to <em>remember what's good</em> after the reader (and myself included) perhaps did not spend the summer doing mathematics.</p>

<p>You are free to initially skim this material, then loop back to it at any time during the semester. Perhaps you'll want to test yourself against some of the inline <webwork /> exercises, which look like:</p>

    <exercise xml:id="degree-centigrade">
      <title>Nice Example of an Inline WeBWork Problem</title>
      <webwork source="Library/CollegeOfIdaho/setAlgebra_01_01_AlgebraicExpressions/11IntAlg_01_AlgebraicExpressions.pg"/>
    </exercise>

    <p>If a problem is broken, kindly email Colton: <url href="mailto:colton.grainger@colorado.edu?subject=pretext-student-guide">colton.grainger@colorado.edu</url>.</p>
  </assemblage>

    <p>Note that you have as many attempts on this problems as you would like. At any time you can (say mercy! and) look at the solutions. </p>
